# 6kyu SHA-256 Cracker

# This kata aims to show the vulnerabilities of hashing functions for short messages.

# When provided with a SHA-256 hash, return the value that was hashed. You are also 
# given the characters that make the expected value, but in alphabetical order.

# The returned value is less than 10 characters long. Return nil for Ruby, None for 
# Python, null for Java when the hash cannot be cracked with the given characters.

# Example:

# Example arguments: '5694d08a2e53ffcae0c3103e5ad6f6076abd960eb1f8a56577040bc1028f702b', 
# 'cdeo'
# Correct output: 'code'
